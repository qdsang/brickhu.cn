It was middle of winter,Snow lay thick on the ground,The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away.When it grew dark,she turned a suitcase into a bed and put her baby inside itï¼Œ**Covering** them with all the clothes she could find.

Druning the night,It got terribly cold,The woman kept as near as he could to the children,and even tried to get into the suitcase herself,But it was too small.

Early next morning,He heared planes passing overhead and wondered how she could sent a singal.Then she had an idea,She stamped out leters 'SOS' in the snow.
 
Fortunately,A pilot saw the singal and send the massage by the radio to the nearest town,It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.
